        <h1>The Handshake Block Clock</h1>
      </div>

      <h2> Blocks </h2>
      Blocks are represented by their hash, expressed in binary. The colors
      in the image are derived from the hash itself. They are labeled
      with their height in the blockchain and time since they were received
      by the server's hsd node. The most recent block hash (chain tip) is also
      copied into the browser tab's "shortcut icon". Blocks "tick" around the
      outside of the clock, which represents 60 minutes of recent chain history.
      The current block hash and its colors are:
      <div style="text-align:center">
        <h2><span id="tiphash" style="font-family:monospace;"></span></h2>
      </div>

      <h2> The Urkel Tree </h2>
      The Urkel Tree is the data structure that stores the Handshake root zone.
      It is updated every 36 blocks on mainnet with all the namestate data from
      the last 36 blocks worth of transactions. The Urkel Tree root hash is
      committed to each block header. In the image, the tree is represented by
      a fractal pattern. The size of the tree is derived from the number of blocks
      passed in the current tree interval from 0 to 36. The color is derived from
      the tree root hash itself, and the fractal "angle" parameter is also derived
      from the hash. The current tree root hash, its color and fractal angle are:
      <div style="text-align:center">
        <h2><span id="treeroot" style="font-family:monospace;"></span></h2>
      </div>

      <h2> The Halvening </h2>
      Currently on mainnet, every new block generates 2,000 HNS for the miners.
      This value reduces by half every 170,000 blocks (about 3.25 years). The
      wedge in the lower half of the clock shows this progress by filling up
      the half-circle. The colors in the wedge are derived from...

      <h2> Difficulty Adjustments </h2>
      Handshake mining difficulty is adjusted after each block, targeting a
      block emission rate of 10 minutes (specifically, 144 blocks / day). The
      difficulty target of each block is committed to in each block's header in
      a <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2924/how-to-calculate-new-bits-value/2926#2926">compact format.</a>
      Lower numbers are "harder" and indicate an increase in network hashpower.
      Because the first byte (ignored by the image) represents an exponent of sorts,
      there may be a sudden jump in the colors when it rolls over. 
      The "bits" value of the last 20 blocks and their colors are:
      <div id="bitslist" style="
        width:100px;
        margin:auto;
        font-family:monospace;">
      </div>

      <h2> Source Code </h2>
      Source code for this website is hosted <a href="https://github.com/pinheadmz/handout/tree/blockclock">on GitHub</a>.
      It is a fork of my <a href="https://github.com/pinheadmz/handout">handout project</a> which
      runs both a simple nameserver and webserver together to host simple, secure
      websites on Handshake names.<br>
      Because the data in the visualizer is only derived from block headers, the
      server only needs to run hsd in SPV mode, and without a wallet! If I decide
      to include mempool data in the clock, I will need to upgrade to a Full Node.
